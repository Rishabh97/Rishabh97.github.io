	<h6>RULES</h6>
	<p id="rules">
	This includes the real bidding mechanism. Each team will be given an equal amount of money. They would be expected to assemble a team with a mix of batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders and wicket-keepers from a pool of players. 
	</p>

	<p id="rules" class="animated wow fadeInLeft">
		A list of all the players available for the auction, along with their base price and value points will be provided. Bidding for each player will begin at his base price. Team with the highest value points at the end of the auction would be declared as the winner. (If not cricket, same can be done for a pool of companies instead of a pool of players)
